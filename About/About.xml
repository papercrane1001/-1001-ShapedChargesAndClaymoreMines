	<description>This mod makes things go boom in a controlled way.  
	Want to mine out an area, but a bedroom is right on the other side of the wall?  No problem.  Set up a directional shaped charge, and the blast will only be in one direction.  
	Shaped charges can be set off manually via the "Detonate" button, but they do set up an invisible tripwire.  This tripwire does not care what sort of creature disturbs it.  
	Front towards enemy.  
	Do not stand in front of the claymore.  
	Do NOT stand in front of the claymore.  
	DO NOT STAND IN FRONT OF THE CLAYMORE.
